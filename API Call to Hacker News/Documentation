A self-contained program to generate a visualization based on data that it retrieves.
The program will use a web application programming interface (API) to automatically request
specific information from a website rather than entire pages.
It will then use that information to generate a visualization.
Because programs written like this will always use current data to generate a visualization,
even when that data might be rapidly changing, it will always be up to date.
