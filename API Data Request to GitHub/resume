web application programming interface (API) automatically request specific
information from a website rather than entire pages.

Because programs written like this will always use current data to generate a
visualization, even when that data might be rapidly changing, it will always be up to date.

A web API is a part of a website designed to interact with programs that
use very specific URLs to request certain information. This kind of request is called an API call. The requested data will be returned in an easily pro- cessed format, such as JSON or CSV. Most apps that rely on external data sources, such as apps that integrate with social media sites, rely on API calls.

The requested data will be returned in an easily processed format,
